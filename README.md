Hello everyone,
this is a personal repository where I will document and store all my experiences in the world of digital electronics, 
specifically in VHDL design for FPGAs. Over time, this repository will be filled with my experiences gained in academia and various professional endeavors. 
I am creating this repository primarily to establish my personal database
